# Bootstrap Fleet Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This is the entry point for Fleet GitOps. Ansible creates a single GitRepo
# pointing to this folder. Everything else is managed via GitOps from here.
# =============================================================================

# No special configuration needed - Fleet will apply all YAML files in this
# directory and subdirectories as raw Kubernetes manifests.
