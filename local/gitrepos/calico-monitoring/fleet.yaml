# 1. DO NOT add 'targets' or 'targetCustomizations' fields
#    (Targeting is controlled by ClusterGroup resources for local cluster)
# 2. For raw Kubernetes manifests: Keep YAML files in same directory
# 3. Use 'defaultNamespace' to ensure proper namespace creation
#
# Targeting: Controlled by ClusterGroup for local/management cluster
# See: README.md for complete documentation

# Calico monitoring configuration for management cluster
