# Fleet v0.13.4 Configuration for monitoring
#
# IMPORTANT RULES:
# 1. DO NOT add 'targets' or 'targetCustomizations' fields
#    (Targeting is controlled by ClusterGroup resources for local cluster)
# 2. For Helm charts: DO NOT mix with raw Kubernetes manifests
# 3. Use 'defaultNamespace' to ensure proper namespace creation
#
# Targeting: Controlled by ClusterGroup for local/management cluster
# See: README.md for complete documentation

# Monitoring stack for management cluster
defaultNamespace: cattle-monitoring-system

# Clean up resources when bundle removed
keepResources: false

# Target management cluster only

- name: management-only
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: management
